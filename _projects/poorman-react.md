## Details

This project is inspired and extends [this talk.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2mMOiCSj5c)

I have implemented `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState` hooks as well.

- Try to change the input value and hit the + button and see the things update.
- Also see the values of `myref` and `useEffect` in the browser console.
