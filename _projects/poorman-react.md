# Poorman's React

This project is inspired and extends [this talk.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2mMOiCSj5c)

I have implemented `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState` hooks as well. This really gave me a deeper understanding in React. Especially the rules of hooks which react team discusses.

{%highlight js%}
function useEffect( callback, dependency) {
  // Implement useEffect
}
{%endhighlight%}
